## The Odin Project - Landing Page

This is the README file for the Odin Project's Landing Page assignment.

### Project Description

This project involved building a basic landing page for The Odin Project, a free web development curriculum. The objective was to create an informative and engaging webpage that introduces visitors to The Odin Project and motivates them to sign up.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I aimed to reinforce the following HTML and CSS skills:

* **HTML Structure and Semantics:**
    * Employed semantic HTML elements like `header`, `nav`, `section`, and `article` to structure the content effectively.
    * Incorporated headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) to organize the information hierarchy.
    * Utilized lists, images, and links to present content in a user-friendly way.
* **CSS Fundamentals:**
    * Applied CSS styles to control the layout of the landing page using properties like `margin`, `padding`, and `display`.
    * Implemented styles for typography, including font size, color, and weight, to enhance readability.
    * Leveraged basic flexbox properties to achieve desired alignments and layouts for specific sections.
